# SmartMarket

This project was completed by me as a coursework for the subject of software design.

Based on the design, developed a desktop application that has the following functionality:

* add a product to the system
* sell goods and update data in the system
* write off (remove) expired goods
* save sales information
* add a new employee to the system
* edit information about the employee
* dismiss (remove) the employee
* view video from surveillance cameras

The project uses the MVC pattern, the Hibernate framework for data access, and the Swing library for building the user interface.

An SQL script for building a MySql database is also attached.

The system is not fully developed due to the large volume and deadline of the work.
